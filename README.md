# multi-counter
Quickly add up things that come in twos or threes, like marks on a test paper.

### How does the counter work?

Just press the `+` key on your keyboard to increment the counter, the `-` key to decrement it, and the numbers 1 through 9 to add that number to the counter. Click the Help button in the app for more

### Installation

All the code is in the standalone `counter.pyw` file. Just clone the repository, extract the files, and run it.

### Requirements

The code requires Python 3 with the `tkinter` library installed.
